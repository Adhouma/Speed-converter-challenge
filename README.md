	/**
	 * Write a method called toMilesPerHour that has 1 parameter of type double with the name
	 * kilometersPerHour.
	 * This method needs to return the rounded value of the calculation of type long.
	 * If the parameter kilometersPerHour is less than 0, the method toMilesPerHour needs to return -1 to 
	 * indicate an invalid value.
	 * Otherwise, if it is positive, calculate the value of miles per hour, round it and return it.
	 * 
	 * Write another method called printConversion with one parameter of type double with the name:
	 * kilometersPerHour
	 * This method should not return anything (void) and it need to calculate milesPerHour from the
	 * kilometersPerHour parameter then it need to print a message in the format "XX km/h = YY ml/h"
	 * 
	 *  XX represents the original value kilometersPerHour
	 *  YY the rounded milesPerHour from the kilometersPerHour parameter.
	 *  
	 *  If the parameter kilometersPerHour is < 0 then print "Invalid value".
